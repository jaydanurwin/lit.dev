In this tutorial we will be inventing our own HTML element: `<word-viewer>`.
You can see it on the right!

This HTML element takes a list of words separated by periods, and shows them one at a time. Like this:

```html
<word-viewer words="Hello.World"></word-viewer>
```

Clicking it plays the words in reverse, and changes some styles.

This is a weird thing to build, but in doing so we'll touch upon all the core concepts you'll use when building your own Lit components.

Lit makes inventing your own new HTML tag easy, and with
this knowledge you can extend HTML!
Inventing your own HTML element means your component will work anywhere HTML works.
And since most frameworks support HTML, your components can work [everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).

Lit is used in many of the world's [most forward-looking organizations](https://lit.dev/#:~:text=looking%20organizations%20are-,building%20with%20Lit,-Spectrum%20Web%20Components).

It's also used to develop open source components that you can use:

 * [&lt;Model Viewer>](https://modelviewer.dev/) - Like an `<img>` tag but for 3D!!!!
 * [Lion component library](https://lion-web.netlify.app/components/) - Fundamental white label web components for building  your design system.

There's nothing to solve in this tutorial part, it's here to show off what you've built by the end. Add your
own `<word-viewer>` tag in the list!

Press "Solve" for more fun with the `<word-viewer>`, and when you're ready to build click "Next".
