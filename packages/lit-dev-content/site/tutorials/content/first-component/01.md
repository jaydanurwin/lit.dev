Let's start by scaffolding out a custom Lit component.

We're going to define the `WordViewer` class, which extends LitElement.

TODO:
 - Explain defining a custom element.
 - Declaring custom tag to TS.
 - `render` is your custom element's render method.

Return `html` tag function from `render` method.

```ts
html`<pre>Render something</pre>`
```
