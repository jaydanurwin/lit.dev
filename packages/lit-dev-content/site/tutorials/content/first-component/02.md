 * We want to pass in words from html.
 * A feature of Lit is [reactive properties](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/). In TypeScript a class member can become a reactive property using the `@property` decorator, and in JavaScript there is a static `properties` field which registers the member name.

Action item:
 - Register `words` so it is a reactive property.
 - Result is that the `words` attribute in HTML will be rendered.

Also try out the dev tools technique shown in the video.
Change the 'words' attribute in: `<word-viewer words="ðŸ‘‹.from.html"></word-viewer>`.

Solution is reached if `ðŸ‘‹.from.html` is shown in the Result.
