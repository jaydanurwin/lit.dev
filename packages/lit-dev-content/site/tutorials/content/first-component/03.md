I've added `idx` and `tickToNextWord` method to the `WordViewer` component!

In this section we will use this to show a single word from our `words`!

 * Describe `@state`.
 * Describe Problem and solution.


First try and split words using `this.words.split('.')`, and then render that single word.

This should show `WrongWord` in the preview window.
This is because the test also calls `tickToNextWord` which increments `idx`.

To trigger a re-render we need to make `idx` a reactive property! But because this is private state, we can use a decorator called `@state`. It's very similar to `@property` but doesn't create an attribute.

After adding `@state` the preview window should show `RightWord`.
