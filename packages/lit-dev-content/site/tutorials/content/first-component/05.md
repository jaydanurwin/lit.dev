We can add styles by using the `css` tag function, and the static `styles` member on the class.

For example, adding this will make the text green.
```ts
  static styles = css`
    pre {
      color: green;
    }
  `
```

There are some web component CSS specifics that we won't go into here. Refer to the [docs on styles](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/) for lots more information.

Main specifics to be aware of is that your CSS in the component is scoped to the component. The example above will not style other `<pre>` tags on the page outside the component.

There is also a special `:host` selector that can be used to style the component itself. See if you can style the component to have a white background and violet color, by selecting on `:host`.
