We're going to add an event handler to the component that changes which way the words play.

I've added to this sample `playDirection` state, and a method `switchPlayDirection` that we want to call when the component is clicked.

Lit provides an [easy way to add event listeners in the element template](http://localhost:5415/docs/components/events/#adding-event-listeners-in-the-element-template) by prefixing the event you want to listen to with `@`.

To call `switchPlayDirection` on click, add `@click=${this.switchPlayDirection}` to the `<pre>` template element.

Solution works when clicking the word-viewer reverses playback!
