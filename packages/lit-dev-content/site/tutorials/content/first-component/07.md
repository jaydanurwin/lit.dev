Change the visuals with the play direction.
ClassMap!

Using classMap, we can efficiently update the classes on the template based on state!

Add the following as a class attribute for the `<pre>` tag:

```ts
classMap({ backwards: this.playDirection === -1 })
```

When `this.playDirection === -1`, a `backwards` class is reactively adde to the `<pre>` element.

Because a new selector for `.backwards` was added, the solution is valid if the word-viewer turns violet when playing backwards!
